### How to start the local development environment

You should clone the project and dive into the webapp folder before you kick off the local development. Please [clone the project and go to the webapp folder](#how-to-create-your-open-star-ter-village-game) if you haven't done it yet.

OpenStarTerVillage - Web app is using yarn 2 workspaces to manage the project. Please ensure you have [latest yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) in your machine before you start it. But don't worry, the yarn 2 upgrade is by-project basis so you can still access the other project with classic yarn 1. Please note that there are some [cli command changes](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/migration#cli-commands) as well.

The follow command would start client UI (create-react-app) in dev server, server (koa) in ts-node under watchmon, and game core (pure-typescript) in watch compile mode.

```shell
yarn dev:webapp
```

Everything is settle up. Ready, get, set, code!
